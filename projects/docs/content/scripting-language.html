<h2>Scripting language</h2>
<p>
Every user project ( or app in case of multi app project ) includes project.ngc.yaml special file. This file is a mix of project 
configuration and source code entries. Content of this file is yaml formatted and we call it NGC scripting languague. Apart from 
obvious project configruation statements in this file we also include top level entry of the code. This means every application 
will start executing the code written project.ngc.yaml first ( unless you decide to keep your code separate ).
</p>
<p>
So why this scripting language even exists? In fact developers can use any other language they want in any app and still it will be 
totally fine. The reason we introduce this language is to have one abstration above all other languages which gives are several 
advantages in the long run. 
</p>
<p>
Firstly, we are no longer obliged to use only TypeScript for shared code in libs. In future we will be support more and more programming 
languages and by introducing scripting languages acts like a adapter. We will be able to use either programming language and even 
automatically reimplement some of the existing functions into another languages.
</p>
<p>
Secondly, by using abstract scripting language we can easly track functions dependencies, create intelligent CI pipelines which is building 
and running tests only for exactly the changed or affected code. 
</p>
<p>
No more imports. You don't need to think of them. Functions are automatically resolved when you start using them. Additinal, external libraries 
are automatically added.
</p>
<p>
Code optimization. By using scripting language you don't produce dead code. Only functions which are actually used are included. 
Moreover, you can benefit from code minification and obfuscation, functions inlining and more.
</p>
<p>
Foundation for spoken language which will allow users with less programming knowledge to contribute to the code, or program in GUI mode.
</p>
<h2>Scripting language reference</h2>
Scripting language in project.ngc.yaml includes both project configuration and code statements:

<h4>from</h4>
<p>
Project configuration statement which defines project base template. Expected value is a relative path to project template starting from 
templates directory. For example:
</p>
<code>from: Docker/web</code><br>
<p>Tells NGC this project is based on Docker/web template project</p>

<h4>do</h4>
<p>Top level "do" keyword is a entry point for code execution. Expected value is a list of scripting language instructions to execute</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<code>
    &emsp;do:<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;- var:<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;name: counter<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;value: 0<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;- Arithmetic/add:<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;args:<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;left: counter<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;right: 1<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;return: counter<br>
</code>
<h4>var</h4>
<p>Defines new variable. Expects 2 properties:</p>
<ul>
    <li>name: name of the variable</li>
    <li>value: value of the variable</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<code>
    &emsp;&emsp;- var:<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;name: counter<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;value: 0<br>
</code>
<h4>Function call</h4>
<p>
You can call any shared libs function by specifing it's relative path in libs directory ( without file extension ). Function call expects 
args property to be set in case any function argument needs to be passed and return property in case you want to save function result. 
Args is not an array but key, value pairs of function arguments names and passed values. Example:
</p>
<code>
    &emsp;- Arithmetic/add:<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;args:<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;left: 2<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;right: 1<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;return: counter<br>
</code>
<h4>function</h4>
<p>
Defines new function. Function definition requires name and do properties. If function takes arguments, set also args which consists of 
key-value paris defining argument name and its type
</p>
<code>
    &emsp;- function:<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;name: printMessage<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;args:<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;msg: string<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;do:<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- Console/Log:<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;args:<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;text: msg<br>
</code>
<h4>if</h4>
<p>
If conditional. Executes code if condition is true. Optionally, executes code if condition is false in else block. conditional expression 
is set in condition key and right now support only plain javascript.
</p>
<code>
    &emsp;- if:<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;condition: counter &gt; 10<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;do:<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- Console/Log:<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;args:<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;text: |<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  "Counter has reached it's maximum"<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;else:<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- Console/Log:<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;args:<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;text: |<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  "Counter not yet saturated"<br>
</code>
<h4>while</h4>
<p>
While loop executes block of code as long as condition is true. Structure is very simillar to if statement except there is no else block
</p>
<code>
    &emsp;- while:<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;condition: counter &lt; 10<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;do:<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- Console/Log:<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;args:<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;text: |<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  "Counter value is" + counter<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;- Arithmetic/add:<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;args:<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;left: counter<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;right: 1<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;return: counter<br>
</code>
