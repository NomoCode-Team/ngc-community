<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Welcome to NGC, a framework to build and deploy full stack applications with ease. We get to know how difficult it might be to learn the all the 
details and nuances of software development, especially for beginners. We also understand the tremendous power of community and how beneficial it 
is to connect people together, allow them working towards same goals. You make think of NGC as another tool to get your job done, make your application running. 
However, the fact is NGC is not just a software. NGC core software is actually really lightweight. What makes it powerful are people.

So what exactly is NGC? The closest definition would be NGC is a build system primarly focused on developing full stack applications.
This is however still really general definition. To give you a taste what NGC can be used for, how it's organized and what can you achieve with it 
let's bring here core concepts and ideas hidden behind it:
</p>
<h4>Everything is a template</h4>
NGC uses Jinja2 templating to render projects content. You can make per project templates or reuse existing ones written by community. 
Collect them together through composition or inheritence and use them as your project basis. Focus directly on your application functionality instead of 
setting up project from scratch.
<h4>Function-centric</h4>
Libraries are not sets of functionalities. They are just virtual containers/groups for functions. Function is the fundamental/atomic brick in NGC.
In your project you bring only these functions which you actually use, not the whole library. You can contribute to the community not only by making projects or
entire libraries. You can create or modify single function which can be then used by variaty of projects and other users with ease. Because of 
this approach we also value more functional programming than object-oriented. However, you still can use OOP if you want.
<h4>Mono-repo approach</h4>
From lessons learned, we value more mono repository approach then dependencies chain. We call working environment a sandbox. Within each sandbox 
you can have multiple projects/applications but also most importantly, sandbox is a storage for common libraries and templates shared between projects.
<h4>Cross-disciplinary</h4>
NGC is not design for programmers only. It is a platform for applications development throughout each stage and level - programming, designing, building,
testing, deploying, configuring and so on. In future also supporting low-code and even no-code applications. You can contribute in many ways and 
choose what suite you best.
<h4>Tools agnostic</h4>
So far you may thought NGC is a tool but it's actually something more. NGC doesn't actually care in which programming language your application will be 
used or which toolset you want to bring. Of course we had to choose some standard tooling - let's call it starter kit. 
Libraries are written in typescript but also other languages will be supported in future. In your project you can actually completely ignore 
tools we integrated and use your own stack as you would outside of NGC framework. NGC is not like a tool but more like a spider net which connects these tools together to leverage 
best ideas from each of it and give you truelly powerful and flexible environment.
<h4>Community driven</h4>
There is nothing special about NGC. The true value of this build system is in it's community and people who contribute to new functionalities and public templates. 
We share the knowledge with each other and support each other. NGC is kind of social experiment in IT space. You may shape how NGC will look like. Apart from core, 
everything else is open-sourced and driven by community. Even the documentation you are reading was built with NGC and thanks to people similar like you. 
Alone software development is hard and you need to have a lot of experience in variaty of tasks. Together we can make it pure pleasure.
