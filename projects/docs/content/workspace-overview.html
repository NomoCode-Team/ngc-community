<h2>Workspace overview</h2>
<h4>What is workspace</h4>
<p>
Workspace is just a git repository with a special structure that enables NGC to operate on it. 
NGC does not care if your workspace is hosted on GitLab, GitHub, Bitbucket or other VCS. Additionally, there exists 
<a href="https://db.nomocode.io/community/sandbox">official community workspace</a> called sandbox. This workspace 
is public and contains open source projects, libraries and templates everyone can benefit from. This is also the default 
workspace being initialized in your sandbox upon creation.
</p>
<h4>Workspace structure</h4>
<p>
As mentioned, NGC relies on special structure of the workspace and we will briefly discuss it below. There are few mandatory 
top level directories that need to exist to call any git repository a NGC workspace.
</p>
<h4>libs</h4>
<p>
This directory contains all of the common functions organized within subfolders. These functions are common meaning they can 
be reused in any project within workspace. Functions are written in TypeScript but in future other languages will be supported.
Each function has it's own file meaning only one function can be stored in single file. Apart from functions, libs folder also 
store tests for functions. Tests are executed using jest javascript test framework. Tests have to end with *.test.ts extension 
and are also written using TypeScript.
</p>
<h4>templates</h4>
<p>
Templates folder holds common Jinja2 templates which can be reused in projects. Templates are split into files and projects. 
Template files are just independent single files wheras templates projects holds whole projects structure and can 
be used as any project foundation.
</p>
<h4>projects</h4>
<p>
This directory keeps all projects within single workspace. We name project an independent fullstack application. From architectural 
point of view project is a collection of microservices that work together as a signle system ( project ). 
</p>
<h4>filters</h4>
<p>
Filters directory contains implamentations of custom Jinja2 filters
