<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>
So, you decided to give it a try? At the current stage NGC is in Alpha release. Only limited amount of users have access to it. 
</p>
<p>
NGC is accessed through remote workspace called sandbox. If you don't have an access to it you may try to request it at our  
<a href="https://discord.gg/CJYHdKCp">developers discord server</a>
Code in sandbox is managed by git version control system. Sandbox can use multiple git repositories (private or public) and there is also one special - <a href="https://db.nomocode.io/community/sandbox">official community sandbox</a>.
This is the default repo when setting up your sandbox.
