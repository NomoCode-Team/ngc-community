# Welcome to NGC Documentation

NGC is a tool to help you create Full-Stack applications. It is designed to bring best development practices powered by extreme programming and devops culture. We strongly believe what makes developers take good design decisions is also subconsiously affected 
by the environment in which they work. NGC is build with practical expierence in mind and aims to reduce design anti-patterns by 
providing development environment in which good design patterns are also easier to bring than the bad ones.
